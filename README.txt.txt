To run the program:

The username and password are both test.  The main screen displays a list of appointments in the next week or in the next month depending on what radio button is selected.  Appointments can be selected to be removed or updated and new ones can be added.  
The Customers screen shows a list of customers in the database. Customers can be selected to be removed or updated and new ones can be added.
The reports screen shows three reports.  The first one shows the total number of appointments by type and by month.  The second shows a complete schedule for the selected customer.  The third report shows the total number of reports created by each user.
